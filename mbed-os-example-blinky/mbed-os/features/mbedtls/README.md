README for mbed TLS
===================

mbed TLS for mbed OS
--------------------

This edition of mbed TLS has been adapted for mbed OS and imported from its standalone release, which you can find on [github here](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls). This edition of mbed TLS does not include test code, sample applications, or the scripts used in the development of the library. All of these can be found in the standalone release.


Getting Help and Support
------------------------

The [mbed TLS website](https://tls.mbed.org/) contains full documentation for the library, including function by function descriptions, knowledgebase articles, blogs and a support forum for questions to the community.


Contributing to the Project
---------------------------

We gratefully accept bug reports and contributions from the community. There are some requirements we need to fulfill in order to be able to integrate contributions:

-   Simple bug fixes to existing code do not contain copyright themselves and we can integrate without issue. The same is true of trivial contributions.
-   For larger contributions, such as a new feature, the code can possibly fall under copyright law. We then need your consent to share in the ownership of the copyright. We have a form for this, which we will send to you in case you submit a contribution or pull request that we deem this necessary for.

Contributions should be submitted to the [standalone mbed TLS project](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls), not to the mbed OS imported edition of mbed TLS.
