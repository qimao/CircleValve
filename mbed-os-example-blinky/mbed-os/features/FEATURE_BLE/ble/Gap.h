/**
 * Define device discovery, connection and link management procedures.
 *
 * - Device discovery: A device can advertise nearby peers of its existence,
 * identity and capabilities. Similarly, a device can scan its environment to
 * find advertising peers. The information acquired during the scan helps to
 * identify peers and understand their use. A scanner may acquire more information
 * about an advertising peer by sending a scan request. If the peer accepts scan
 * requests, it may reply with additional information about its state.
 *
 * - Connection: A bluetooth device can establish a connection to a connectable
 * advertising peer. Once the connection is established, both devices can
 * communicate using the GATT protocol. The GATT protocol allows connected
 * devices to expose a set of states that the other peer can discover, read and write.
 *
 * - Link Management: Connected devices may drop the connection and may adjust
 * connection parameters according to the power envelop needed for their
 * application.
 *
 * @par Accessing gap
 *
 * Instance of a Gap class for a given BLE device should be accessed using
 * BLE::gap(). The reference returned remains valid until the BLE instance
 * shut down (see BLE::shutdown()).
 *
 * @code
 * // assuming ble_device has been initialized
 * BLE& ble_device;
 *
 * Gap& gap = ble_device.gap();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Advertising
 *
 * Advertising consists of broadcasting at a regular interval a small amount of
 * data containing valuable informations about the device. These packets may be
 * scanned by peer devices listening on BLE advertising channels.
 *
 * Scanners may also request additional information from a device advertising by
 * sending a scan request. If the broadcaster accepts scan requests, it can reply
 * with a scan response packet containing additional information.
 *
 * @code
 * // assuming gap has been initialized
 * Gap& gap;
 *
 * // construct the packet to advertise
 * GapAdvertisingData advertising_data;
 *
 * // Add advertiser flags
 * advertising_data.addFlags(
 *    GapAdvertisingData::LE_GENERAL_DISCOVERABLE |
 *    GapAdvertisingData::BREDR_NOT_SUPPORTED
 * );
 *
 * // Add the name of the device to the advertising data
 * static const uint8_t device_name[] = "HRM";
 * advertising_data.addData(
 *     GapAdvertisingData::COMPLETE_LOCAL_NAME,
 *     device_name,
 *     sizeof(device_name)
 * );
 *
 * // set the advertising data in the gap instance, they will be used when
 * // advertising starts.
 * gap.setAdvertisingPayload(advertising_data);
 *
 * // Configure the advertising procedure
 * GapAdvertisingParams advertising_params(
 *     GapAdvertisingParams::ADV_CONNECTABLE_UNDIRECTED, // type of advertising
 *     GapAdvertisingParams::MSEC_TO_ADVERTISEMENT_DURATION_UNITS(1000), // interval
 *     0 // The advertising procedure will not timeout
 * );
 *
 * gap.setAdvertisingParams(advertising_params);
 *
 * // start the advertising procedure, the device will advertise its flag and the
 * // name "HRM". Other peers will also be allowed to connect to it.
 * gap.startAdvertising();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Scanning
 *
 * Scanning consist of listening for peer advertising packets. From a scan, a
 * device can identify devices available in its environment.
 *
 * If the device scans actively, then it will send scan request to scannable
 * advertisers and collect their scan response.
 *
 * @code
 * // assuming gap has been initialized
 * Gap& gap;
 *
 * // Handle advertising packet by dumping their content
 * void handle_advertising_packet(const AdvertisementCallbackParams_t* packet)
 * {
 *    printf("Packet received: \r\n");
 *    printf("  - peer address: %02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X\r\n",
 *           packet->peerAddr[5], packet->peerAddr[4], packet->peerAddr[3],
 *           packet->peerAddr[2], packet->peerAddr[1], packet->peerAddr[0]);
 *    printf("  - rssi: %d", packet->rssi);
 *    printf("  - scan response: %s\r\n", packet->isScanresponse ? "true" : "false");
 *    printf("  - advertising type: %d\r\n", packet->type);
 *    printf("  - advertising type: %d\r\n", packet->type);
 *    printf("  - Advertising data: \r\n");
 *
 *    // parse advertising data, it is a succession of AD structures where
 *    // the first byte is the size of the AD structure, the second byte the
 *    // type of the data and remaining bytes are the value.
 *
 *    for (size_t i = 0; i < packet->advertisingDataLen; i += packet->advertisingData[i]) {
 *        printf("    - type: 0X%02X, data: ", packet->advertisingData[i + 1]);
 *        for (size_t j = 0; j < packet->advertisingData[i] - 2; ++j) {
 *            printf("0X%02X ", packet->advertisingData[i + 2 + j]);
 *        }
 *        printf("\r\n");
 *    }
 * }
 *
 * // set the scan parameters
 * gap.setScanParams(
 *      100, // interval between two scan window in ms
 *      50,  // scan window: period during which the device listen for advertising packets.
 *      0,   // the scan process never ends
 *      true // the device sends scan request to scannable peers.
 * );
 *
 * // start the scan procedure
 * gap.startScan(handle_advertising_packet);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Connection event handling
 *
 * A peer may connect device advertising connectable packets. The
 * advertising procedure ends as soon as the device is connected.
 *
 * A device accepting a connection request from a peer is named a peripheral,
 * and the device initiating the connection is named a central.
 *
 * Peripheral and central receive a connection event when the connection is
 * effective.
 *
 * @code
 * Gap& gap;
 *
 * // handle connection event
 * void when_connected(const ConnectionCallbackParams_t *connection_event) {
 *    // If this callback is entered, then the connection to a peer is effective.
 * }
 *
 * // register connection event handler, which will be invoked whether the device
 * // acts as a central or a peripheral
 * gap.onConnection(when_connected);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Connection initiation
 *
 * Connection is initiated central devices.
 *
 * @code
 * // assuming gap has been initialized
 * Gap& gap;
 *
 * // Handle the connection event
 * void handle_connection(const ConnectionCallbackParams_t* connection_event)
 * {
 *    // event handling
 * }
 *
 * // Handle advertising packet: connect to the first connectable device
 * void handle_advertising_packet(const AdvertisementCallbackParams_t* packet)
 * {
 *    if (packet->type != GapAdvertisingParams::ADV_CONNECTABLE_UNDIRECTED) {
 *       return;
 *    }
 *
 *    // register connection event handler
 *    gap.onConnection(handle_connection);
 *
 *    Gap::ConnectionParams_t connection_parameters = {
 *       50, // min connection interval
 *       100, // max connection interval
 *       0, // slave latency
 *       600 // connection supervision timeout
 *    };
 *
 *    // scan parameter used to find the device to connect to
 *    GapScanningParams scanning_params(
 *      100, // interval
 *      100, // window
 *      0, // timeout
 *      false // active
 *    );
 *
 *    // Initiate the connection procedure
 *    gap.connect(
 *       packet->peerAddr,
 *       packet->addressType,
 *       &connection_parameters,
 *       &scanning_params
 *    );
 * }
 *
 * // set the scan parameters
 * gap.setScanParams(
 *      100, // interval between two scan window in ms

 *      true // the device sends scan request to scannable peers.
 * );
 *
 * // start the scan procedure
 * gap.startScan(handle_advertising_packet);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par disconnection
 *
 * The application code initiates a disconnection when it calls the
 * disconnect(Handle_t, DisconnectionReason_t) function.
 *
 * Disconnection may also be initiated by the remote peer or the local
 * controller/stack. To catch all disconnection events, application code may
 * set up an handler taking care of disconnection events by calling
 * onDisconnection().
