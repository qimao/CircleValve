/** Block device for managing a Master Boot Record

 *
 *  Here is an example of partitioning a heap backed block device
 *  @code
 *  #include "mbed.h"
 *  #include "HeapBlockDevice.h"
 *  #include "MBRBlockDevice.h"
 *
 *  // Create a block device with 64 blocks of size 512
 *  HeapBlockDevice mem(64*512, 512);
 *
 *  // Partition into two partitions with ~half the blocks
 *  MBRBlockDevice::partition(&mem, 1, 0x83, 0*512, 32*512);
 *  MBRBlockDevice::partition(&mem, 2, 0x83, 32*512);
 *
 *  // Create a block device that maps to the first 32 blocks (excluding MBR block)
 *  MBRBlockDevice part1(&mem, 1);
 *
 *  // Create a block device that maps to the last 32 blocks
 *  MBRBlockDevice part2(&mem, 2);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Here is a more realistic example where the MBRBlockDevice is used
 *  to partition a region of space on an SD card. When plugged into a computer,
 *  the partitions will be recognized appropriately.
 *  @code
 *  #include "mbed.h"
 *  #include "SDBlockDevice.h"
 *  #include "MBRBlockDevice.h"
 *  #include "FATFileSystem.h"
 *
 *  // Create an SD card
 *  SDBlockDevice sd(s0, s1, s2, s3);
 *
 *  // Create a partition with 1 GB of space
 *  MBRBlockDevice::partition(&sd, 1, 0x83, 0, 1024*1024);
 *
 *  // Create the block device that represents the partition
 *  MBRBlockDevice part1(&sd, 1);
 *
 *  // Format the partition with a FAT filesystem
 *  FATFileSystem::format(&part1);
 *
 *  // Create the FAT filesystem instance, files can now be written to
 *  // the FAT filesystem in partition 1
 *  FATFileSystem fat("fat", &part1);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  @note
 *  The MBR partition table is relatively limited:
 *  - At most 4 partitions are supported
 *  - Extended partitions are currently not supported and will error during init
