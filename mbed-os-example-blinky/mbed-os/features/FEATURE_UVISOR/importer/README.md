# Rebuilding the uVisor mbed Library

This directory contains scripts to import and rebuild the latest uVisor library to mbed Classic.
uVisor does not need to be re-deployed for normal application development.

For uVisor development and code contributions please visit the [uVisor repository](https://github.com/ARMmbed/uvisor).
